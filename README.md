# RegenBlocks - _Bukkit Plugin to regenerate blocks_
This Plugin regenerates blocks after a set amount of time. Each block set to regenerate can have its own delay. You can also set the specific worlds for regeneration to apply on, as well as a replacement block which will replace the regen block when broken.
